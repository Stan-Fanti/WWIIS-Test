# WWIIS Test
 Stan Iurie Fanti's entry test for World Wide Internet Insurance Services.

## Letter Counter
For this test we’d like you to create a method called countLettersInString inside the provided class LetterCounter (see email attachment). The method should take a single string parameter and return a string containing each case-insensitive letter in the parameter followed by a colon and an asterisk for each occurrence of the letter, separated by a commas, with no spaces.
Example:
Input: “WWIIS Services Ltd”
Output: “w:\**, i:\*\**, s:\*\**, e:**, r:*, v:*, c:*, l:*, t:*, d:*”

## Get Key Holders
A script has been written to retrieve the people who have a key to access a local community hall from a database. The database has two tables, the first is key_holders, which stores the name of the person, the type of key they have been given (a “master” key to open all doors, a “safe” key to access the safe, and a “front door” key), whether their key is still active and an in use, and finally in which order they should be contacted in an emergency. The second table is contact_details which holds the name of the person and their contact telephone number.
A number of bugs and errors existing in the script which you’ll need to identify and fix. For each fault found include a comment on what the fault was, the errant behaviour it caused, and how you fixed it, along with any other comments you feel are relevant.
